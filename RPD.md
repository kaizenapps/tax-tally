# Roadmap / Project Document (RPD) for Tax Tally Web Application

Below is a detailed Roadmap/Project Document (RPD) outlining the tasks and milestones to build the Tax Tally web application. This document is broken into chunks so that an AI coding agent (or developer team) can methodically implement each part. Each chunk represents a logical grouping of tasks, from initial setup to feature integrations and deployment.

---

## 1. Project Setup and Configuration

### 1.1. Repository and Environment Setup
- **Initialize Git Repository:**
  - Create a new repository (if not already done) and clone it locally.
- **Set up Next.js Project:**
  - Run `npx create-next-app tax-tally` to bootstrap the project.
  - Remove unused directories (e.g., `src/app/` if migrating fully to pages).
- **Install Tailwind CSS:**
  - Follow the official Tailwind CSS installation for Next.js:
    - **Install dependencies:**
      ```bash
      npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
      ```
    - **Generate config files:**
      ```bash
      npx tailwindcss init -p
      ```
    - **Configure `tailwind.config.js`** to include the `pages/` (and optionally `components/`) directories.
- **Create Environment Files:**
  - Add a `.env.local` file in the project root with keys for:
    - **Stripe:** publishable and secret keys, webhook secret.
    - **Firebase:** project ID, client email, private key.
    - **Botpress secret** (if used) and **Telegram Bot token**.
  - **Example content:**
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-client-email
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-firebase-private-key"
    BOTPRESS_SECRET=your_botpress_shared_secret
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
    ```
- **Version Control Note:**
  - Ensure sensitive information in `.env.local` is not committed (use `.gitignore`).

## 2. Project Directory Structure and Global Styling

### 2.1. Directory Organization
Ensure the following structure:

tax-tally-web/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   └── Footer.js
├── lib/
│   └── firebaseAdmin.js
├── pages/
│   ├── _app.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── feature.js
│   ├── preview/
│   │   └── [id].jsx
│   └── api/
│       ├── create-preview.js
│       ├── get-preview.js
│       ├── create-checkout-session.js
│       ├── stripe-webhook.js
│       └── download/
│           └── [id].js
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.png
│   └── … (other assets)
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
└── …

### 2.2. Global Styling (Tailwind + Custom CSS)
- **Update `styles/globals.css` with the theme:**
  - Use Tailwind directives:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
- **Define custom CSS variables** (e.g., teal-inspired palette) and dark mode preferences.
- **Add a pseudo-element grid overlay** on `<main>` for a 30% transparent grid effect:
  ```css
  main {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
  }
  main::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    pointer-events: none;
    z-index: -1;
    background-size: 20px 20px;
    background-image:
      linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255,255,255,0.3) 1px, transparent 1px),
      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255,255,white,0.3) 1px, transparent 1px);
    opacity: 0.3;
  }

### 2.3. Favicon Integration
	•	Place your favicon.png inside the public/ folder.
	•	Ensure it’s included by adding a link in _document.js (or in _app.js global <Head>).

⸻

## 4. API Routes for Dynamic Workflows

### 4.1. PDF Generation and Preview Record
	•	API: /pages/api/create-preview.js
	•	Accepts data from Botpress (e.g., PDF URL, user info) and generates a unique preview record stored in Firebase.
	•	API: /pages/api/get-preview.js
	•	Fetches preview data for a given unique ID.

### 4.2. Payment Integration (Stripe)
	•	API: /pages/api/create-checkout-session.js
	•	Creates a Stripe Checkout session for $2.99.
	•	API: /pages/api/stripe-webhook.js
	•	Listens for Stripe webhook events to update payment status in the preview record.
	•	Secure Download Endpoint: /pages/api/download/[id].js
	•	Validates payment status and serves the PDF file.

⸻

## 5. Backend Services Integration

### 5.1. Firebase Firestore
	•	Setup Firebase Admin SDK:
	•	Configure lib/firebaseAdmin.js with the credentials from the environment variables.
	•	Use Firebase to store and retrieve preview records.

### 5.2. pdf.co API Integration
	•	PDF Generation:
	•	Use pdf.co API from within your Botpress action or a dedicated API route.
	•	Ensure generated PDFs are stored or accessible via a URL stored in Firestore.

### 5.3. Botpress Chatbot Integration
	•	Webhook/Action Integration:
	•	Create a custom Botpress action (or workflow step) that calls your /api/create-preview endpoint once PDF generation is complete.
	•	Return the preview URL to the user on Telegram/WhatsApp.

⸻

## 6. Testing, Deployment, and Monitoring

### 6.1. Local Testing
	•	Verify all API endpoints using Postman or cURL.
	•	Test UI components in the browser by navigating to the landing, features, and preview pages.

### 6.2. Deployment Preparation
	•	Vercel Deployment:
	•	Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
	•	Set environment variables in Vercel’s dashboard.
	•	DNS & SSL:
	•	Ensure your custom domain (e.g., tax-tally.com) is configured with appropriate SSL certificates.

### 6.3. Monitoring and Debugging
	•	Stripe Logs & Webhooks:
	•	Test Stripe webhook integration using the Stripe CLI locally.
	•	Firebase Debugging:
	•	Verify data records in Firestore.
	•	Botpress Logs:
	•	Monitor Botpress for successful API calls and response times.

⸻

## 7. Documentation and Future Improvements

### 7.1. Documentation
	•	Document API endpoints with sample requests/responses.
	•	Write usage guidelines for Botpress integrations and Firebase setup.

### 7.2. Future Improvements (Optional)
	•	UI Enhancements:
	•	Introduce animations, improved accessibility features, or additional sections.
	•	User Authentication:
	•	Optionally add full authentication if user accounts become necessary.
	•	Analytics & Monitoring:
	•	Integrate logging (e.g., Sentry or LogRocket) to capture runtime errors and user experience metrics.

⸻

## 8. Concurrency and Unique User Workflow

### 8.1. User Session Handling Overview

Each user’s conversation is handled as an independent session by Botpress.
	1.	Individual Chat Sessions:
	•	Each user (A, B, and C) interacts with the Botpress chatbot.
	•	Their responses are stored independently, ensuring isolation.
	2.	PDF Generation per User:
	•	After finishing their tax data, Botpress triggers the pdf.co API to generate a unique PDF for each user.
	3.	Creating a Preview Record:
	•	Botpress then makes a POST request to /api/create-preview with:
	•	The PDF URL generated by pdf.co for that specific user.
	•	The user’s unique identifier (or metadata).
	4.	Unique Record in the Database:
	•	The Next.js API endpoint creates a unique record (using a UUID) in Firebase.
	•	This record holds the PDF URL, payment status (initially set to “pending”), and any additional metadata.
	5.	Sending a Unique Preview URL:
	•	The API returns a unique preview URL (e.g., https://tax-tally.com/preview/12345abc).
	•	Botpress sends this URL back to the user.
	6.	User Interaction on the Website:
	•	When a user clicks their unique preview URL, they are taken to a dedicated preview page (dynamic route: /preview/[id].jsx).
	•	The page fetches the correct PDF and payment details from Firebase.
	•	Payment and download functionalities are tied to that specific record.

## Summary:
	•	Botpress handles each conversation separately: Data and PDF generation are done per session.
	•	API endpoint creates unique records: Each PDF gets its own unique preview record in Firebase.
	•	Unique preview URLs are sent back: Each user receives a preview URL specific to their session.
	•	Preview page fetches data by unique ID: Ensuring each user sees only their own PDF and related payment status.

This design ensures complete isolation of user data, even during simultaneous interactions.

This Roadmap/Project Document (RPD) provides a granular breakdown of tasks and modules for the Tax Tally web application. Working through each chunk ensures that the overall system—from the Next.js frontend, API integrations (Stripe, Firebase, pdf.co), to Botpress chatbot workflows—is implemented systematically for maximum efficiency and maintainability.
